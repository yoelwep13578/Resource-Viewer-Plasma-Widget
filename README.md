### 2. Install Nerd Font
Nerd Font is a font with additional icon sets. It needs to be installed for some icons to render correctly. You can download & choose it from [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) with your preference.

If you donâ€™t want to choose, simply download [JetBrains Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/JetBrainsMono.zip)

After downloaded the zip file, just extract it to the Desktop temporarily.
Then, install (move) using this command:

```sudo mv /home/yourname/Desktop/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/TTF/```

(replace yourname with your actual Linux username)

> Sometimes, system need to be restarted to refresh any changes
