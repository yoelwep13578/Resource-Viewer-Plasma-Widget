### 2. Move Scripts to Your Location
To keep it simple, you can move the ```Scripts``` folder to ```/home/yourname/```
```
$ mv ./Scripts /home/yourname/
```

### 3. Install Output Command Widget

### 4. Install Nerd Font
Nerd Font is a font with additional icon sets. It needs to be installed for some icons to render correctly. You can download & choose it from [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) with your preference.

After downloaded the zip file, just extract it to the Desktop temporarily.
Then, install (move) using this command:
```
$ sudo mv /home/yourname/Desktop/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/TTF/
```

> Sometimes, system need to be restarted to refresh any changes

<br>
But if you donâ€™t want to choose, simply install JetBrains Mono Nerd Font that included in this repo. Then install it.

```
$ sudo cp ./Fonts/* /usr/share/fonts/TTF/
```

<br>

## Setting Up
### Initial Set-up
CPU, RAM, Disk, Storage, and Temperature must be attached separately. This means you can use each of these widgets according to your needs and attach them anywhere you like.
